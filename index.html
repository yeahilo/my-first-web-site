This is <strong>LaLa Land <u>song</u> that makes me happy</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_La_Land" target="_blank" title="lala land song">click me!</a>
<p>Summer Sunday nights We'd sink into our seats Right as they dimmed out all the lights A Technicolor world made out of music and machine It called me to be on that screen And live inside each scene</p>

<p style="margin-top:45px;">Without a nickel to my name Hopped a bus, here I came Could be brave or just insane We'll have to see 'Cause maybe in that sleepy town He'll sit one day, the lights are down He'll see my face and think of how He used to know me</p>
